            We understand it might not be feasible to hire another counselor due to budget constraints, which is why this training was created. When counselors are given the best education, tools, and training they can use their time more efficiently and their workload significantly decreases. This offsets the challenge of having an otherwise unfavorable student to counselor ratio, without having to make another hire.

When Counselors are asked to describe what aspects of their job they are struggling with, there are three top responses. Our training addresses these challenges directly with proven solutions. Additionally, our experience in providing schedule-building services to students who couldn&apos;t get expert advice from their counselors has given us deep, targeted insights into best practices that counselors can adopt for better outcomes.
