    question: "What if I don&rsquo;t know what my major will be yet? What if I change my mind?",
    answer:
      "Though it may help for increased planning and schedule optimization, knowing your major is not required. The program is set up so that changes to your major will have a minimal impact on your timeframe.",
  },
  {
    question: 'My child is in 8th grade, is it too soon to start?',
    answer:
      'Our service is tailored to students in 8th grade or above, as most states allow students to begin taking dual credit courses in their freshman or sophomore year of high school. Getting started early is the best way to plan for college. We can also assist new high school grads and up to sophomores in college with optimizing their college schedules for an early graduation.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What payment methods do you accept?',
    answer:
      'We primarily process payments via Stripe (credit card, Klarna, Apple Pay, or Cash App Pay). We can also accept payment via PayPal, wire transfer, or cryptocurrency.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the duration of the one-on-one planning service?',
    answer:
      'The program consists of eight sessions, and we maintain an open line of communication through your college graduation. Our goal is to have you in full control of your academic situation, with ongoing support whenever you need it.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How does this work with scholarships?',
    answer:
      'Scholarships allow you to save additional money on college, and you may even be eligible for new scholarships because of your plans to graduate early. We will help you apply for scholarships and ensure you remain eligible.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do transfer credits make my degree less impressive?',
    answer:
      'No. There is no differentiation on your degree whether all credits are earned at one university or across multiple institutions.',
  },
  {
    question: "What if I don&rsquo;t pass a class? How much more challenging are dual credit courses?",
    answer:
      'Dual credit courses can be more challenging mentally, but from a time and workload standpoint they are often easier or less time consuming. Ultimately, success comes down to attending class and doing the work.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need to live in a major city or near a college to access dual credit courses?',
    answer:
      'Not at all. Dual credit opportunities are available in small towns and online. If you live in a rural area, we help you find options nearby or through virtual programs.',
  },
  {
    question: "My situation is different, but I&rsquo;m interested. Should I still schedule a call?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We&rsquo;ll talk through your specific needs and be upfront about the best path forwardâ€”whether that&rsquo;s with us or another solution.",
  },
  {
    question: 'Money back guarantee?',
    answer:
      "Yes. If we don&rsquo;t save you more than the cost of our service, we&rsquo;ll refund everything you&rsquo;ve paid.",
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I have to pay this all at once? Do you offer financing or payment plans?',
    answer:
      'We offer financing through Affirm. Offers are personalized, and many families qualify for 0% interest plans across multiple term lengths.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Why should I pay for this service instead of trying to do it on my own?',
    answer:
      'Optimizing a dual credit plan takes experience. Families routinely save tens of thousands more with our guidance, while also avoiding hours of research and second guessing.',

                We make it possible for students in 8th through 11th grade to earn their bachelor&rsquo;s degrees in two years by creating optimized high school schedules that utilize dual credit classes (classes that count for both high school and college credits).
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
                By following our methodologies, students and their parents can save an average of $70,000 on education costs and start earning a professional income two years sooner than their peers. We created this service in direct response to the often inadequate and expensive advice offered by consultants and high school counselors, who may not have the most current information.
